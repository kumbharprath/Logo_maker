For the backend:
bash
docker build -t backend-app ./backend

For the frontend:
bash
docker build -t frontend-app ./frontend

#### Run the Containers:

bash
docker run -d --name frontend-container -p 3000:3000 frontend-app
docker run -d --name backend-container -p 5000:5000 backend-app

## AWS EC2 (Optional)
You can deploy the application on AWS EC2. Ensure that your EC2 security group allows traffic on ports 3000 (frontend) and 5000 (backend).

## Jenkins (Optional)
You can automate the build and deployment using Jenkins. Please refer to the Jenkinsfile for pipeline configuration.
